Sucedió en plena noche mientras cortaba pan para un tentempié culpable.
Mi atención fue capturada por el ruido de un mapache fuera de mi ventana.
Esa fue, creo, la primera vez que noté mis extrañas inclinaciones como un humano poco ordinario.
Le di al mapache un trozo de pan, mi subconsciente plenamente consciente de las consecuencias.
Bien sabía que un mapache alimentado siempre volverá por más.

La belleza tentadora de mi cuchillo fue el síntoma.
El pan, mi curiosidad hambrienta.
El mapache, un impulso.

La luna avanza en su fase y refleja aún más luz en mi cuchillo.
La misma luz que brilla en los ojos de mi amigo mapache.
Corto el pan, fresco y suave. El mapache se emociona.
O tal vez solo proyecto mis emociones en el animal recién satisfecho.

El mapache ha comenzado a seguirme.
Podría decirse que ya nos hemos acostumbrado el uno al otro.
El mapache tiene hambre cada vez más a menudo, así que siempre tengo pan a la mano.
Cada vez que levanto mi cuchillo, el mapache muestra su emoción.

El mundo más fácil para perderse
es aquel donde todo puede encontrarse.

Solo se pueden construir castillos de arena donde la arena está húmeda.
Pero donde la arena está húmeda, llega la marea.
¿Lamerá suavemente tus cimientos hasta que te rindas?
¿O una ola repentina te derribará en un abrir y cerrar de ojos?

Estoy de pie donde la espuma rodea mis tobillos,

I look again at the sky,

The hole has become more massive.

I see a white light through this 
hole
I squint my eyes to adjust to the brightness caused by this hole,

My eyesight adjusts and I see a large, 

imposing

black silhouette looking at me from the hole.

Who is it?

The world around me has started dissipating, showing a deep black void.


Was... it all wrong?

Is this world fake?

Whites artifacts flash in front of my eyes.

The lack of oxygen is starting to reach my lungs.

I panic.

And I close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy eyes."""

I awaken to find myself recreated. 

From the depths of hell that I've escaped. 
My fingertips are bleeding as I scrape the edge. 

To observe the rising sun; I bury the past's remains.

I celebrate, this is as an wonderful day. 

I've awakened to a new world that has already taken shape. 

A new beginning for my weary heart; 
I wash my hands in the spring. 

The red dissipating with a pleasant sigh. 

I sense his gaze penetrate me. 
I finally feel..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsecure."""
